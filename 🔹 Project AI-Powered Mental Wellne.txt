🔹 Project: AI-Powered Mental Wellness Analyzer
1. What is the Project About?

This is a web application that analyzes how your social media activity (Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, etc.) affects your mental wellness.

The app takes user input about their daily digital usage.

It applies sentiment/emotion mapping to categorize moods (positive / neutral / negative).

It then shows visualizations (charts) of how each platform impacts mood.

Finally, it provides personalized recommendations for better mental wellness.

⚡ In simple words: It’s like a “Mood Mirror” for your online life.

2. Why Did We Build It?

Problem: People spend 4–6 hours daily on social media → this directly impacts mental health (anxiety, FOMO, burnout).

Gap: There’s no simple tool that shows how specific platforms affect your emotions in real-time.

Hackathon Relevance: It blends AI + health + visualization into a single, impactful project.

👉 Our goal is to make people aware of their digital habits and empower them to take control of their emotional wellbeing.

3. Purpose of the Project

Awareness → Users realize how Instagram reels, YouTube videos, or WhatsApp chats affect them differently.

Prevention → Negative patterns (too much scrolling, late-night usage) can be spotted early.

Empowerment → Personalized recommendations guide users to fix unhealthy habits.

Scalability → Can evolve into a mental health companion app.

4. How Does the Project Work?

Let’s break it step by step:

🔸 Step 1: Input

The user fills a form in the web app.
Example:

Instagram → “Scrolled reels for 2 hrs”

YouTube → “Watched motivational videos”

WhatsApp → “Chatted with friends”

🔸 Step 2: Processing

We use sentiment mapping:

“Motivational” → Positive

“Scrolled aimlessly” → Negative

“Friends chat” → Positive

For hackathon demo: mapping is rule-based (dictionary of positive/negative keywords).

In future: can integrate ML/NLP model (HuggingFace Transformers, Vader Sentiment).

🔸 Step 3: Output

Mood displayed on screen (cards: Green = Positive, Yellow = Neutral, Red = Negative).

A chart (bar/pie/line) shows mood distribution across platforms.

Recommendations shown below → e.g.,

Negative mood → “Take a walk, listen to calming music”

Neutral → “Stay consistent, avoid distractions”

Positive → “Keep journaling, maintain balance”

5. How the Code Works
⚙️ Backend (Python Flask / Django or simple script)

Input from user → captured in form.

Text processed → keywords checked in a dictionary.

Assigns mood scores: positive = +1, negative = -1, neutral = 0.

Prepares result dictionary like:

results = {
    "Instagram": "Negative",
    "YouTube": "Positive",
    "WhatsApp": "Positive"
}


Sends this results to HTML template.

🖥️ Frontend (HTML + CSS + Chart.js)

Uses Jinja template ({% if results %}) → results shown only after analysis.

Chart.js renders dynamic graph using passed Python data.

CSS ensures clean, modern look (cards, gradients, responsive design).

🔄 Flow Example

User types → “Scrolled reels aimlessly.”

Code detects → “aimlessly” → Negative.

Backend sends → {Instagram: Negative}.

Frontend shows → Red Card + Graph with Negative bar.

Suggestion shown → “Take a break, avoid endless scrolling.”

6. Uses of the Project

Students → Track stress from online classes + social usage.

Professionals → Detect burnout from long work/scrolling.

Parents → Monitor children’s digital wellness.

Healthcare Startups → Integrate as mental wellness add-on.

7. Hackathon Alignment

AI/ML → Sentiment analysis (currently rule-based, scalable to ML).

Health & Wellness → Promotes mental wellness.

Data Visualization → Interactive charts.

Tech for Good → Accessible web tool for everyone.

Scalability → APIs, mobile app, AI-based journaling.

8. Every Inch You Can Explain
🔹 Input Form

Why simple? → Judge-friendly, quick demo.

Why customizable? → Each user gives unique usage.

🔹 Sentiment Mapping

Rule-based → ensures fast demo (no heavy ML).

Easy to extend → can later plug in real ML model.

🔹 Results Cards

Color-coded → helps users instantly understand mood.

Accessible → green/yellow/red universal indicators.

🔹 Charts

Bar chart → shows distribution of moods.

Pie chart → shows percentage of moods.

Future → line chart for daily/weekly mood trends.

🔹 Recommendations

Not generic → tailored to that mood.

Adds practical impact → not just “you’re sad,” but “do this to feel better.”

9. Future Scope

Connect to Instagram/YouTube APIs → fetch real usage automatically.

Add machine learning sentiment classifier → better accuracy.

Mobile app version → notifications + journaling.

Integrate with wearables → detect stress via HR/steps.
